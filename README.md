## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
This is my 2nd Tailwind CSS project, most important thing I learned this time around is how to host your own font.
Also, each time you use Tailwind CSS you learn more names for utiliy classes, ultimatly you get quicker at developing.
Got to love Tailwind
